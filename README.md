# Credit_Card_DA
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and transaction patterns within the credit card industry. The primary objective was to identify key revenue drivers, customer segments, and usage trends to provide actionable insights for optimizing credit card offerings.

The analysis is based on two datasets:
- Credit Card Dataset: Contains transaction details, including card categories, annual fees, credit limits, and more.
- Customer Dataset: Includes demographic information such as age, income, job type, and satisfaction scores.

The data was imported into PostgreSQL for storage and management, and then visualized using Power BI.

# Key Objectives: 
- Identify revenue patterns across different customer segments and quarters.
- Analyze card activation rates, delinquency rates, and transaction volumes.
- Explore customer demographics to understand their impact on credit card usage.
